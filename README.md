# MyVeterinary Application 

It's a project for learning more about Xamarin and Net.Core technologies. I followed the tutorial 58 - MyVet given by Juan Carlos Zuluaga's teacher.

The Juan Carlos Zuluaga is an excellent teacher and the tutorial can be found in his youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeSJh3cP6hyfY4km8E2HVmw
